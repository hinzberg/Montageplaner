## Assembly Planning: An Angular and CSS Learning Project
A small, hands-on Angular project for exploring Angular concepts and CSS techniques. 
I use this repository as a playground to learn, experiment, and prototype ideas including components, routing, state management, 
Signals, forms and many more.

The idea for this project is based on an application I developed many years ago. A lightweight app for planning the deployment of personnel and equipment on construction sites. Let's wait and see how it turns out this time.

### Goals
- Create a low-risk space to try new Angular and web platform features.
- Provide example patterns for component design and styling.
- Encourage experimentation and incremental learning.
- Keep the project small and modular so features can be isolated and changed easily.
